      <description>In the previous post of this series, I covered how k-means clustering works in detail. In this post, I will try to explain the k-medoids algorithm, also known as Partitioning Around Medoids. First, I will explain what k-medoids is, then I will explain how it works step by step, and then I will explain how to implement it using the R program language.
What is k-medoids? k-medoids is a clustering algorithm that is similar to k-means, but instead of using the mean of the observations in each cluster as the centroid, it uses one of the observations in the cluster as the &amp;quot;medoid.</description>
